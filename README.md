# Solidty-notes-with-code

This repository contains all the code I have written while learning Solidity by myself. The first few files aren't that great because I haven't put many comments in them
but the later complex topics are very well commented with explanantion for each new thing I've used.


You can treat it like a referemce for your solidity learning journey
